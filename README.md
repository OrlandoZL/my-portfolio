# my-portfolio

## description

The motivation behind this is knowing I can have a useful wepage to use to get hired. I built this project to create a webpage to show the work I've done to potential employers and so they can get more information about me. This solves the problem of having to show my work directly and individually to each employer. I learned how to style and resize a webpage. As well as structing it to look more organizedl.
